Customer complaints can provide valuable insights into the issues people are facing in the marketplace, allowing us to understand the root cause and make necessary modifications to existing financial products if needed.
Through analyzing and understanding past complaints registered against financial products, we can develop a machine learning model that can help us identify newly registered complaints and determine whether they are problematic or not. This can enable the company to take swift action to resolve the issue and address the customer's needs, leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention.

The problem is to identify registered complaint will be disputed by customer or not.
